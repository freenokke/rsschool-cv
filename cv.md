## **About myself**
_The desire to learn Javascript, because I like the frontend direction. I also want to work in this field. I am purposeful, I like to learn new technologies/libraries and apply the skills I have learned, despite the fact that it is sometimes quite difficult, so one of my favorite quotes is:_
>The road surrenders to the one who walks it.

_At the moment, I haven't commercial experience, only the development of websites / landing pages for training purposes_
